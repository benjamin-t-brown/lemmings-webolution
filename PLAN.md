# Lemmings Webolution — Reimplementation Plan

An open reimplementation of **Lemmings Revolution** (Psygnosis Leeds / Take-Two, 2000)
in C++23 on SDL2 + OpenGL, building natively on MSYS2/UCRT64, Linux, macOS, and
WebAssembly.

The goal is a **1:1 mechanical match** with the original, starting at its native
640×480 and only later taking advantage of SDL2/GL for resolution and presentation.

No game data is redistributed. The engine reads `lemmings.box` and `patch.box`
from an existing installation at runtime, in the manner of OpenRCT2 / devilutionX /
OpenTTD.

## 1. What we already know

### 1.1 The game binary

`Lemmings Revolution.exe` — x86, MSVC, 832 KB, unpacked, no protection.
DirectDraw4 + Direct3D immediate mode (HAL). Mouse and keyboard via DirectInput.

**Relocations are stripped, so it always loads at `0x400000`.** This is the single
most useful fact in the project: every address below is stable across runs, and the
live process can be read with `ReadProcessMemory` without any address discovery.

Addresses mapped so far (verified against the running game):

| Address | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `0045F1FE` | `push 1E0h` — render height, the game's only resolution decision |
| `0045F203` | `push 280h` — render width |
| `0046EA17` | `Renderer::Init(w, h, bpp, bWindowed)` |
| `0046F507` | Display init: surfaces, viewport, `SetDisplayMode` |
| `004702A7` | `D3DVIEWPORT2` fill — `dwWidth/dwHeight` from render size, clip volume `[-1,1]` |
| `0047BF16` | `FindMode(w, h, bpp)` over the enumerated list |
| `0047BE9B` | `EnumDisplayModes` callback — accepts every mode, no filtering |
| `0058CD80` | Renderer singleton. `+0B8/+0BC` render w/h, `+17C/+180/+184` requested w/h/bpp, `+2D` windowed flag, `+3C` screen object, `+9C/+A0` centring offsets |
| `0058CB40/44` | Cursor bounds (= render w/h) |
| `0058D294/98` | Cursor centre (= render w/2, h/2) |
| `0058CE0C/10` | Window origin |
| `0045BFED` | Settings load from registry |
| `0045C7E2` | Cursor configuration (`CursorMode`, `FloatingCursorDir`, `ShowIcons`) |
| `0047B178` | `Cursor::SetAspect(w, h)` |
| `00455F40` | Per-frame cursor update (fixed vs free-floating paths) |
| `004567EF` | Mirrors the internal cursor onto the system cursor |

Original module names, recovered from retained `ASSERT` source paths:

```
3DEngine\HardwarePC.cpp      3DEngine\RawBitmap.cpp     3DEngine\TexturePC.cpp
SkyIslands\SkyIslands.cpp    SkyIslands\LoadBMPImage.cpp
Sprites\SpriteSheets.cpp     Sound\SoundManagerPC.cpp   File\FilePC.cpp
```

`SkyIslands` is the game layer; `LoadBMPImage.cpp` is where the texture decoder lives.

### 1.2 The asset container — solved

Derived independently from the bytes and cross-checked against ccexplore's
documentation on Lemmings Forums; the two agree field for field.

```
char[6] "LEMBOX"
u32     count
u32     nameBlockBytes
u8[nameBlockBytes]  count × (u32 len, char[len])   -- no NUL terminators
u32 count ; u32[count] offsets   -- absolute from start of file
u32 count ; u32[count] sizes
payload
```

`lemmings.box` parses to 10,661 entries with **zero gaps and zero slack** — the
parser is exact, not approximate. `patch.box` is the same format: 311 entries, 299
of which override `lemmings.box` by name, 12 new, plus a `.\PATCH.LST` manifest.
Load order is therefore: base, then patch overlay.

Contents:

| Ext | Count | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `.BMP` | 10,376 | **Not** Windows BMP. LRZ-compressed (see below) |
| `.LVL` | 102 | Levels. 699 KB – 1.9 MB each. **The unsolved format** |
| `.ALF` | 81 | 8-bit alpha plane, dimensions match the sibling `.BMP` |
| `.WAV` | 73 | Standard RIFF PCM, 22050 Hz |
| `.SPR` | 19 | Sprite sheets; reference texture sheets with frame rects |
| `.LTX` | 6 | Localised string tables |
| misc | 4 | `LEVELS.MAP`, `LEVELMAP.DAT`, `RELEASERATE.PC`, `PSPBRWSE.JBF` |

### 1.3 Texture format — solved by the community

`.BMP` entries use **LRZ**, a custom scheme with canonical-Huffman trees for
literal-run lengths, copy lengths and distances. A reference C implementation is
published in the Lemmings Forums thread, but only as a login-gated attachment,
and the prose description of the tree construction is too loose to reimplement
from. So `src/assets/Lrz.cpp` is transcribed directly from the hand-written
assembly instead:

```
.text:00467DE8  decode(src, dst, packedSize, unpackedSize) -> bytes produced
.text:00467EB7  read one tree (nibble depth list)
.text:00467F0D  build it into the node arena
.text:00467FED  decode one number, with or without a tree
```

The chunk header's third field, undocumented as "usually 4", is a **method id**:
3 = stored, 4 = compressed. Decoded texture entries are ordinary Windows BMPs.

`tools/lrz-oracle` maps the original exe at its fixed base and calls that routine
directly, giving a reference implementation to diff against -- the same
no-relocations trick the differential oracle relies on. Our decoder is **byte
identical** to it, and decodes all 10,383 texture entries to valid bitmaps.

Filename prefixes are semantic, and the data matches the documented meanings:

| Prefix | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `^` | A sibling `.ALF` alpha file exists |
| `+` | Has an embedded alpha channel |
| `$` | Colour `#404040` is transparent |
| `_` | Colour `#000000` is transparent |
| `~` | Additive blending |

### 1.4 Metadata formats — solved

All four are implemented in `src/assets/GameData.cpp` and parse the retail files
exactly, consuming every byte. Two of the published descriptions turned out to be
wrong, both caught by parsing the real data:

- `LEVELMAP.DAT` — 125 entries: id, display name, time limit, save target, total
  lemmings. Unused slots are present and named `blank`.
- `LEVELS.MAP` — **five counted groups of 25**, not one flat list of 125. The
  groups are the difficulty tiers, in play order. Each group restarts MFC's
  per-archive class table, so its first slot carries the full `CLevelSlot` class
  header (`FFFF`, schema, name) and the rest use the `8001` "same class" tag.
  Every slot id resolves against `LEVELMAP.DAT`.
- `RELEASERATE.PC` — **99 doubles**, not `u32` + float pairs: seconds per lemming,
  falling from 5.0 at rate 1 to 0.2 at rate 99.
- `.LTX` — `u32 count`, `u32[count]` offsets, then NUL-terminated strings; 232 per
  language across 8 languages. The encoding is **not** uniformly Windows-1252:
  each localisation uses its locale's ANSI codepage, so Polish and Czech need
  1250 and Hebrew needs 1255. A single table would silently corrupt three of the
  eight. A `^` inside a string is the game's line break.

### 1.5 `.LVL` — the open problem

Not publicly documented. Structural probe of `MM_CLIMB_002.LVL` (699 KB):

```
0x000000  (8)  "Level 23"
0x00002c  (9)  "_curNoLem"      script variables, sigil-typed (_ ^ ~ + @ ! $ & *)
0x0000b7  (11) "+shadow_new"
0x00010f  (42) "Cylinder\MM_CLIMB_002\INN_MM_CLIMB_002_0_0"
0x00013d  (42) "Cylinder\MM_CLIMB_002\OUT_MM_CLIMB_002_0_0"
          ...  INNer / OUTer cylinder surfaces, tiled grid [col]_[row]
0x0a5d21  (11) "PolyList 09"    many geometry chunks
0x0aaa27  (4)  "cyl2"
```

Strings are `u32`-length-prefixed. Layout appears to be: header → script variables →
cylinder texture grid → polygon lists → terrain/collision data.

**The key structural insight for the whole project:** Revolution is a 2D game wrapped
onto a cylinder. The simulation is a flat terrain mask with horizontal wraparound;
the cylinder is presentation. We can therefore build and test the entire simulation
before writing a single line of 3D rendering.

## 2. Verification strategy — the differential oracle

Because the original loads at a fixed base and we can read its memory live, we can
run it as a **reference implementation**:

1. Drive the original to a known level state.
2. Each tick, read lemming positions, states, counters and terrain out of its memory.
3. Step our simulation with identical input and assert the states match.

This converts "1:1 mechanics" from an aspiration into a regression test. It is how
we pin down sub-pixel movement, rounding, tick ordering and the exact frame on which
a builder places a brick — the things that are impossible to get right by observation.

### 2.1 Driving the original — solved

The game reads input exclusively through DirectInput and **ignores every form of
Windows input injection** (`SendInput`, `mouse_event`, `keybd_event` all have no
effect). That blocked automation entirely.

Its whole input surface turns out to be two `IDirectInputDevice::GetDeviceState`
calls:

```
.text:00483B5D   GetDeviceState(0x10,  &DIMOUSESTATE)    device ptr at this+0x28
.text:00483E1A   GetDeviceState(0x100, keys[256])        device ptr at this+0x100
```

`tools/dinput-shim` is a 32-bit `dinput.dll` proxy that forwards everything to the
real `SysWOW64\dinput.dll` and patches exactly two COM vtable slots:

```
IDirectInputA        vtable[3]  CreateDevice     -> catch each device
IDirectInputDeviceA  vtable[9]  GetDeviceState   -> serve state from shared memory
```

No wrapper COM objects, no DLL injection — `dinput.dll` is not a KnownDLL, so the
application directory wins the search order. Confirmed in the live process:

```
DINPUT.DLL   C:\progs\Lemmings Revolution\DINPUT.DLL   <- shim
dinput.dll   C:\WINDOWS\SysWOW64\dinput.dll            <- real, loaded by the shim
```

`tools/harness/lrinput.py` writes the shared block. **Verified end to end:** the game
polls at 144 Hz, and scripted `DOWN` taps walk the main menu one item per tap while
scripted relative mouse motion moves the same highlight — with no human present.

Two properties that matter for the oracle:

- **Frame-accurate.** `mouse_frame` / `key_frame` increment on every read, so the
  harness can inject exactly one tick of motion and block until it is consumed
  (`consume_deltas` zeroes the deltas after each read). No sleep-and-hope.
- **Non-invasive.** With `enable = 0` every call passes straight through, so the game
  plays completely normally and the shim can stay installed permanently.

## 3. Phases

### Phase 0 — Groundwork
- Repo skeleton matching Carcer conventions: C++23, CMake 3.28+ / Ninja, `src/Makefile`
  convenience front end, clangd, `Name.h`/`Name.cpp` pairing (`.hpp` = header-only),
  sources registered in `cmake/*_sources.cmake`, presets for gcc/clang debug+release,
  ucrt64, and emscripten.
- Dependencies: **plain SDL2 + a hand-rolled OpenGL layer + STL.** No SDL2W, no BMIN —
  they are 2D/sprite-oriented and would be bypassed by a GL cylinder renderer anyway.
- Ghidra install (Java 24 is already present), import the exe, seed with §1.1.

### Phase 1 — Asset layer
- `lembox` reader, base + patch overlay, reading the user's install at runtime.
- LRZ decoder ported from the published reference.
- `.ALF`, `.LTX`, `.WAV`, `LEVELMAP.DAT`, `LEVELS.MAP`, `RELEASERATE.PC`.
- `lrtool` CLI: list, extract, convert.
- **Milestone: all 10,376 textures decoded to PNG and visually verified.**

### Phase 2 — `.LVL`
- Ghidra on the `SkyIslands` loader; incremental parser; debug visualiser.
- **Milestone: one level's cylinder geometry and terrain mask on screen.**

### Phase 3 — Simulation (headless, deterministic, unit-tested)
- Terrain mask with horizontal wrap; fixed timestep; no rendering dependency.
- Lemming state machine: walker, climber, floater, bomber, blocker, builder, basher,
  miner, digger — plus the Revolution-specific mechanics visible in the assets
  (anti-grav shafts, trampolines, water, acid, axes, evil rats, cylinder rotation).
- Validated continuously against the differential oracle.

### Phase 4 — Rendering
- SDL2 + OpenGL, targeting a GLES3-compatible subset so WebGL2 is nearly free.
- Flat unwrapped 2D debug view at 640×480 first; then wrap onto the cylinder using
  the INN/OUT texture grid.
- `.SPR` sheet-based sprite animation.

### Phase 5 — Game shell
Menus, level select, save games, `.LTX` localisation, audio. FMV is an open question —
the `.avi` codecs are not yet identified.

### Phase 6 — Platform targets
Linux, macOS, and WebAssembly via Emscripten.

## 4. Risks, ranked

1. **`.LVL` format** — high, and on the critical path. Everything downstream waits on it.
2. **Exact physics constants** — medium. The oracle de-risks this substantially, and
   driving the original is now solved (§2.1).
3. **3D model geometry** — low/medium. Assumed to live in the `.LVL` PolyLists;
   unconfirmed. `TEXTURES\MODELS\...` implies separate model data somewhere.
4. **FMV codecs** — low. Cosmetic, and deferrable to the very end.
